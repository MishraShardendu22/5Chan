error in html template 
The error you're seeing occurs because EmailTemplate is a React component, which is treated as a value in TypeScript, but you're trying to use it as a type. This is causing TypeScript to throw an error.

Explanation:
In TypeScript, types and values are different things. When you define a React component, like EmailTemplate, it is a function or JSX element, and thus it is a value.
When you use EmailTemplate in your function parameters or type declarations, TypeScript expects you to treat it as a value or a function, but not as a type.
The error message:

Edit
'EmailTemplate' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here. Did you mean 'typeof EmailTemplate'?
This suggests that youâ€™re trying to use EmailTemplate as a type when it is actually a React component. In TypeScript, you can only pass the type of a React component by using typeof EmailTemplate.
